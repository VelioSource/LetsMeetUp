## 🧠 About the Project

This isn’t just another website; it’s a **social bridge**. Born from a genuine fear of isolation and a dream to change that, *Let’s Meet Up!* offers a welcoming platform for those seeking meaningful human connection in unfamiliar places.

The idea began with the question:  
**"What if I never find friends in this new place?"**

That question turned into sketches, code, and eventually — the prototype you're now exploring.
